# Climate Disaster Warning System

This repository contains the code, models, and supporting materials for detecting and analyzing climate-related disasters‚Äîspecifically fire, flood, and sea-level rise events. The project integrates deep learning and geospatial data analysis to support early warning systems and climate research.

## üß† Models Overview

### üî• Fire Detection

* **Model**: ResNet50 (Keras-based)
* **Approach**: Binary image classification (fire vs. non-fire) with transfer learning
* **Justification**: ResNet50's deep architecture and residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradients and boost accuracy on image tasks.

### üåä Flood Detection

* **Models**: ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT)
* **Approach**: Image-based flood classification and evaluation
* **Justification**: ResNet is a proven CNN model, while ViT captures global context via self-attention, enhancing performance in complex flood imagery.

### üåê Sea-Level Rise Analysis

* **Data Source**: GRACE satellite NetCDF files
* **Tools**: Data processing and visualization in Jupyter Notebooks
* **Justification**: GRACE data offers precise Earth gravity measurements, enabling accurate inferences about sea-level and mass redistribution trends.
